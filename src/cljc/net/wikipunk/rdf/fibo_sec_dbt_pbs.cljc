     "An asset-backed security (ABS) is a type of financial investment that is collateralized by an underlying pool of assetsâ€”usually ones that generate a cash flow from debt, such as loans, leases, credit card balances, or receivables. It takes the form of a bond or note, paying income at a fixed rate for a set amount of time, until maturity. ABS are financial securities backed by income-generating assets such as credit card receivables, home equity loans, student loans, and auto loans. Pooling assets into an ABS is a process called securitization. One difference between an ABS and a collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is that the CDO issuer is generally a special purpose vehicle (SPV) or trust.@en"],
