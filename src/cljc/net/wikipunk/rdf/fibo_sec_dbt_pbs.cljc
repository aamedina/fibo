    "Structured finance instruments represent a form of securitization technology which can be defined by three key characteristics: (1) pooling of financial assets, such as loans, bonds, or credit-default swaps; (2) de-linking of the credit risk of the asset pool from the credit risk of the originating firm, usually through use of a finite-lived, stand-alone special purpose vehicle (SPV); and (3) issuance by the SPV of \"tranched\" liabilities backed by the asset pool. Structured finance instruments are typically presented to large financial institutions or companies with complicated financing needs that are unsatisfied with conventional financial products.@en",

This is not only used for Yield calculations though. It is referred to as an analytic figure in its own right. Average Life uses one of a number of standard pre-payment models (for structured finance at least). For MBS, the average life includes some calculations to take account of pre-payments on the underlying mortgages. This takes account of the possibillity of borrowers paying early. This has to be modeled or forecast (not given) as it's a function of market conditions and interest rate. You would not see this in a market data feed. When you model MBS you calculate Average Life as part of the model i.e. you estimate the percentage of prepayment in the next x length of time and factor this into the Average Life. Refers to Weighted Average Time to receipt of future cash flows. For MBS, early payments will shorten the Average Life.
